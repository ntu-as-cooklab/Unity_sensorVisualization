## How to prepare data files for this Project ##

After building the unity project, create a **"data" folder** in the same location of the unity program. Put several txt files named "sensor_index.txt" and one file named "InitialPosition.txt" in data folder. Then the unity project will present the location of each sensor.

+ **"sensor_index.txt"** contains the position(x,y,z,axes in cm) and ypr angle (degree) of each sensor, sampled every 100ms, following with the time tag and a status string used for visualization label. The unity program will detect how many files in the data folder and create the correspondent sensor images in the tree scene.    
+ **"InitialPosition.txt"** contains the initial position(x,y,z,axes in cm) of each sensor. For example, if you create 5 "sensor_index.txt", the there should be 5 lines in "InitialPosition.txt".

Check the "data" folder in the repository as an example.



    
    
## About this project ##

There are two scene in the unity project.  
+ **"tree"** scene present all the sensors we have at the same time, and show the time tag in "sensor_index.txt".After pressing "Choose" button and choose one of the sensor, the project will change to "single_sensor" scene.      
+ **"single_sensor"** scene presents one single sensor with an Cartesian coordinate(cm) , time tag, and the last string in "sensor_index.txt".Check "sensor_0.txt" in the repository as an example.  
  
  
    
      
      
As for the script,  
***Axis*** and ***Axis_2*** draw the Cartesian coordinate, ***Scale*** create the number tag on the coordinate.
***SensorCreater*** will create Box objects according to ***sensor_index.txt*** in datat folder.
***Box_Move*** load the sensors' position from txt files, and ***Box_line*** create the blue line drawing on the sensor passage.
***Button*** contains all the button's script, and ***Label*** controls the time and acceleration label.
***CamaraMove*** enables user to move camera position by pressing and moving the mouse, and scroll the wheel for changing the distance. Adjust the "(min/max)distance" to change the initial and min/max camera position relatives to the origin of the Cartesian coordinate.

If the user wants to change the "data" folder's name, then change the "path" variable in "SensorCreater"and "Box_Move", in line 9 and 106 respectively.
