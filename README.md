# unity_sensor-Visualization
Program for 6-Axis sensor's moving visualization



After building the unity project, create a "txt" folder in the same location of the unity program. Put several txt files named "sensor_index.txt" and a file named "InitialPosition.txt" in txt folder. Then the unity project will present the location of each sensor.

"sensor_index.txt" contains the position(x,y,z,axes in cm) and ypr angle (degree) of each sensor, sampled every 100ms.
"InitialPosition.txt" contains the initial position of each sensor.

check the "txt" folder in the repository as an example.
